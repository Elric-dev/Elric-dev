Hello, World. 

I am a Machine Learning and AI Engineer specializing in the architecture and deployment of scalable intelligent systems. Currently I work at Caronte Developers, a specialized consulting firm, I focus on bridging the gap between theoretical model development and production-ready software solutions.

My work centers on Python-based ecosystems*, where I leverage a deep proficiency in several programming languages to build robust, efficient, and maintainable backends for complex AI applications.

** Core Expertise: **

Artificial Intelligence & ML: Designing, training, and fine-tuning models for diverse industrial applications.

Foundational Engineering: Building the infrastructure required to support high-performance AI, including data pipelines and MLOps.

Technical Leadership: Managing the end-to-end lifecycle of technical projects from initial consultation to final delivery.

* While my primary focus is Python, I maintain proficiency in a broad range of languages and frameworks to ensure seamless integration across different tech stacks.

Professional Experience and NDAs

A significant portion of my most impactful work, including custom enterprise solutions and proprietary algorithms developed via Caronte Developers, is protected under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Consequently, my public contribution graph and open-source repositories do not reflect the full scope of my professional output.

I am committed to transparency regarding my technical capabilities. For those interested in evaluating my coding standards, architecture design, or problem-solving methodology, I can provide sanitized code samples or conduct a technical walkthrough of specific non-proprietary modules upon request.

Technical Toolkit

Languages: Python (Primary), JavaScript, SQL.

AI/ML: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face, OpenCV.

Infrastructure & Tools: Docker, Git, AWS/GCP, Linux Server Administration, CI/CD Pipelines.

Academic and Research Focus

Beyond consulting, I am active in benchmarking and research, specifically within the realm of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and high-performance computing. My current research involves optimizing lightweight frameworks for real-time signal processing and model training on restricted-resource lab servers.

Contact and Collaboration

I am always open to discussing new challenges in the AI space or potential consulting engagements.
