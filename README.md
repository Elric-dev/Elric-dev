Hello, World. 

I am a Machine Learning and AI Engineer specializing in the architecture and deployment of scalable intelligent systems. Currently I work at Caronte Developers, a specialized consulting firm, I focus on bridging the gap between theoretical model development and production-ready software solutions.

My work centers on Python-based ecosystems*, where I leverage a deep proficiency in several programming languages to build robust, efficient, and maintainable backends for complex AI applications.

## Professional Experience and NDAs

A significant portion of my most impactful work, including custom enterprise solutions and proprietary algorithms developed via Caronte Developers, is protected under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Consequently, my public contribution graph and open-source repositories do not reflect the full scope of my professional output.

I am committed to transparency regarding my technical capabilities. For those interested in evaluating my coding standards, architecture design, or problem-solving methodology, I can provide sanitized code samples or conduct a technical walkthrough of specific non-proprietary modules upon request.

## Contact and Collaboration

I am always open to discussing new challenges in the AI space or potential consulting engagements.

Inquiries: Please reach out via LinkedIn or through the Caronte Developers official channels.
